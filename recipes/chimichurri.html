    <h1>Argentinian-Style Chimichurri Sauce</h1>
    <img src="../images/chimichurri.jpg">
    <p><em>Chimichurri</em> is one of the most delicious and versatile sauces around. It's traditionally served with grilled steak or ribs and is an essential part of an Argentinian parrillada or barbecued mixed grill (see below for further definition). It goes great with chicken and fish, and is a must with grilled chorizo sausages. Chimichurri works well as a marinade and also gives a spark of flavor to vegetables. </p>
